# ForecastNet

> NOTE: Please consider using the PyTorch code rather than the TensorFlow code for the following reasons:
> - The Tensorflow code only considers univariate data.
> - The training function in train.py is fairly rudimentary and is specific to a particular data format.
> - The TensorFlow code style is not refined.
> - The code is based on an old version of TensorFlow (version 1.12.0).

TensorFlow implementation of ForecastNet described in the paper entitled 
"ForecastNet: A Time-Variant Deep Feed-Forward Neural Network Architecture for Multi-Step-Ahead Time-Series Forecasting" 
by Joel Janek Dabrowski, YiFan Zhang, and Ashfaqur Rahman.

ForecastNet is a deep feed-forward neural network multi-step-ahead forecasting of time-series data. The model is designed for (but is not limited to) seasonal time-series data. It comprises a set of outputs which are interleaved between a series of "cells" (a term borrowed from RNN literature). Each cell is a feed-forward neural network which can be chosen according to your needs. This code presents ForecastNet with two different cell architectures: one comprising densely connected layers, and one comprising a convolutional neural network (CNN).

The key benifits of ForecastNet are:
1. It is a time-variant model, as opposed to a time-invariant model (In the paper we show that RNN and CNN models are time-invariant).
2. It naturally increases in complexity with increasing forecast reach.
3. It's interleaved outputs assist with convergence and mitigating vanishing-gradient problems.
4. The "cell" architecture is highly flexible.
5. It is shown to out-perform state of the art deep learning models and statistical models.

## Usage

Run the demo.py script to train and evaluate ForecastNet model on a synthetic dataset. You can write your own graph structures by modifying denseForecastNet.py or convForecastNet.py.

## Notes
 
- This code has been written for univariate time-series data. To extend to multivariate time-series, simply flatten the data. For example, a M-dimensional time-series with T samples can be expressed by a MxT matrix. The matrix can be flattened into a M*T vector. For a multidimensional output, the Gaussian log-likelihood cost function would require modification.
- The training function in train.py is fairly rudimentary and is specific to a particular data format. Please update it according to your preferences.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6
- TensorFlow version 1.12.0
- NumPy 1.14.2.
